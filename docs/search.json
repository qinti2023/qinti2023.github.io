I’m a bioinformatician and currently work as a Research Assistant at Zhejiang University(ZJU), specializing in the realms of machine learning and bioinformatics, areas that captivate my interests deeply.\nWith a background in bioinformatics and data visualization, I possess adept skills in utilizing Python and R programming languages. Additionally, I possess a foundational understanding of Linux commands, having engaged in bulk and single-cell transcriptomics analyses.\nMoreover, my guiding principle, “Humility in acknowledging one’s limitations marks the inception of transcending biases,” encapsulates my worldview and approach to navigating the intricacies of life."
